## Project Overview
This project analyzes the resource needs of Microsoft new movie studio. Descriptive analysis of title basics, title ratings and movie gross shows that high ratings increases total gross.


### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. I am charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.Then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` 
I used the below data sets to get insights and findings that could be well suited for the microsofts movie studio

* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **GitHub repository**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **non-technical presentation**


## Conclusion
This analysis leads to three recommendations for improving Microsoft's new movie studio.

* **Monitor Trends:** Stay updated with the latest trends and preferences in movie genres. Audience preferences can change over time, so adapting to these changes is crucial for success.
* **Quality over Quantity.** Instead of producing numerous movies in various genres, focus on delivering high-quality content. A well-crafted film in the right genre can outperform multiple mediocre ones.
* **Adapt to Audience Trends.** Keep a close eye on changing audience preferences and trends. The movie industry is dynamic, and adapting to evolving tastes is essential.

## Next Steps
Further analysis could yield additional insights to further improve Microsoft new movie studio:

* **Market Research.** Conduct in-depth market research to understand audience preferences, emerging trends, and the competitive landscape. To refine your genre choices and identify potential gaps in the market consumer demands.
* **Audience Feedback.** Gather feedback from test screenings and early releases to refine your movies before their official launch. Listen to your audience to make improvements and adjustments.


## Summary
This project allowed me to leverage the power of data analysis and machine learning to understand the world of movies, discover patterns and trends, and offer recommendations to Microsoft Movie studio.
